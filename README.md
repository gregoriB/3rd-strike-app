# Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike Frame Data

#### [Check it out here! ](https://3rd-strike-frame-data.netlify.com/)

Just a simple frame data site for *Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike*. Made with React because I may add interactive components in the future and make it native on mobile using React Native.

If any of the data is incorrect, you have found a bug or flaw in the site, or you just have a suggestion for how to improve upon it, please feel free to open a new issue and I will address it as soon as possible.  Presently the site is far from complete and is especially lacking with regard to the mobile experience.

The frame data used was scraped from http://ensabahnur.free.fr/BastonNew/ using [my own scraper extension](https://github.com/gregoriB/3rd-strike-web-scraper-browser-extension).  Special thanks to all involved in bringing that website to life and creating an amazing resource for the 3rd Strike community!
